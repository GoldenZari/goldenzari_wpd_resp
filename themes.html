            <h2>Ruthlessness</h2>
            <p>One of the most prevalent themes in <strong>Epic the Musical</strong> is "Ruthlessness." Many characters justify their actions through ruthlessness, believing it is necessary to protect themselves and their own. For example, Polyphemus in the Cyclops Saga lashes out at Odysseus' crew after they harm his sheep, believing that if none survive, the rest of his flock will be safe. Similarly, Poseidon enacts justice by punishing Odysseus and his men for harming his son.</p>
